## About

This is a web analytics tool that runs on Android devices. Its like Google Analytics, minus the ad-peddling Evil. And _you_ keep your data.

In short, you add a line of Javascript calling your phone. That's it. Annonymized visits are stored in your phone. Later they're compiled into charts, counters and so on which you can view in a web page (accessible only in your local network).

## How this works

![diagram](diagram.png)
This is really just a glorified log viewer.

When someone visits your website, Javascript sends a `GET <domain>/damn_fine_coffee`[1] and Nginx creates a log entry (it doesn't log other endpoints[2]).

Every day at around midnight, a cron job processes the day's logs[3]. Invalid logs (duplicated requests or requests originating from non-monitored domains) are discarded, IPs are annonymized using MD5 hashing, and geo info (city-level) is calculated from the IPs. Each valid log entry becomes a row of the `hits` table.

The `hits` table is then used by the `viewer` app and we get the final dashboards, charts etc. The viewer app is based on the excellent [blazer](https://github.com/ankane/blazer) gem, so read their documentation if you want to add more charts or dashboards.

## Requirements

1. An Android phone running [Termux](https://termux.com/) (recommended: set up [SSH remote access](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access)). Remember to press "Acquire wakelock" on Termux as well;
2. A publicly accessible domain leading to your phone. An easy and free way to do this is with a Dynamic DNS subdomain and a port forwarding rule in your router redirecting TCP port `443` to port `8433` on your phone's local IP (port `80` to `8080` if you don't want SSL).

Optional:
1. Verified SSL certificate (see [guide](https://lbrito1.github.io/blog/2020/06/free_https_home_server.html)), necessary in some cases (see section [About SSL](#about-ssl));
2. A [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) account if you want map charts.

## Installation

In your Android phone:
1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it;
2. Create your `.env` config file with `cp -n .env.template .env` and add your passwords, domains etc. If you don't have a SSL certificate, comment out the SSL-related parts of `config/nginx.conf` (more on that in the _About SSL_ section below);
3. Run the setup script: `bash bin/setup.sh`;

In the website you want to monitor, add a call to your phone:
```html
<script> fetch("https://my-android-domain/damn_fine_coffee"); </script>
```

All set! Now if you access your monitored website from outside your network (e.g. with [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/)) and run `tail -f log/nginx.access.log` on your phone, you should see the request getting logged.

Next step is to manually run the compiler job (`./bin/compile_logs.sh`), which will send that request to the DB (by default it is ran daily at 23:59 -- just run it manually once to see if everything is OK).

Now run `./viewer/bin/run.sh` to start the viewer app (it will take a while the first time because of gem installatios). Open `http://<your-phones-local-ip>:3000`, click on one of the charts and you should see some data! ðŸŽ‰

### About SSL

Nginx, used in this project, supports SSL certificates. If you want to use this to count e.g. your personal Github Pages page's traffic, you'll a valid SSL certificate. Good news is they're free and reasonably easy to get. I wrote a guide [here](https://lbrito1.github.io/blog/2020/06/free_https_home_server.html) that will help you.

After you have your SSL keys, put them somewhere in your phone and update `nginx.conf` if necessary with the paths:
```
ssl_certificate /data/data/com.termux/files/home/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /data/data/com.termux/files/home/privkey.pem;
```
Then reload nginx with `nginx -s reload`.

If you don't want to use SSL, you'll need to comment out the SSL-related parts of `nginx.conf` and run `.bin/restart.sh` to get Nginx working.

## Notes

[1] Most crawlers/bots won't magically know about the `/damn_fine_coffee` endpoint without the help of a sitemap or something, so hopefully so you won't get random traffic being logged.

[2] The web is full of crawlers, mostly hitting `/`, but also `/tp-link`, `/admin` etc. We want to just ignore those.

[3] Leveraging [Nginx log rotation](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/logrotation/).
